Thank you for using the coin match api. This api can be used to compare prices for various cryptocurrencies across several platforms for the purposes of price analysis, research, and logging. Coin match can also be used to compare one exchange to another, and display whatever currencies are available on those exchanges.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
python3+
virtualenv
pip
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Clone the respository to your local environment

```
git clone https://github.com/htmercury/coin_match_api.git
```

Move into the git directory

```
cd coin_match_api
```
Initialize a virtual environment
```
virtualenv djangoPy3Env
```
Activate the virtual environment
```
Windows: call djangoPy3Env/Scripts/activat
Mac/Linux: source djangoPy3Env/bin/activate
```
Install the required packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Move into the project directory
```
cd coin_match
```
Start the django server
```
python manage.py runserver
```

Final Output:

## Running the Tests

In the project folder ```coin_match_api/coin_match```,
run ```python manage.py test``` to run the given unit tests

### Break Down End to End Tests

Two Categories of Unit Tests

# Model Tests
These tests if the model is functioning correctly by checking if objects can be created and deleted.
Example:
```
 def test_model_can_create_an_exchange(self):
        """Test the exchange model can create an exchange"""
        old_count = Exchange.objects.count()
        self.exchange.save()
        new_count = Exchange.objects.count()
        self.assertNotEqual(old_count, new_count)
```
This test checks if a new exchange object can be instantiated in the database.

# API Tests
These tests if the API responds to different REST methods made to the API endpoints.
```
    def test_api_can_update_an_exchange(self):
        """Test api can delete a given exchange"""
        exchange = Exchange.objects.get(id=1)
        change_exchange = {
        "name": "apples",
        "owner": "admin",
        "buy_fee": "0.25%",
        "sell_fee": "0.16%",
        "desc": "good stuff",
        "products": [1],
        "created_at": "2018-07-24T16:43:16.699539Z",
        "updated_at": "2018-07-24T17:14:27.916056Z",
        "past_trades": []
    }
        url = '/exchange/' + str(exchange.id)
        res = self.client.put(
            url,
            change_exchange
        )
        self.assertEqual(res.status_code, status.HTTP_200_OK)
```
This test checks if the API can update an existing exchange that was made by a PUT request.

## Deployment
